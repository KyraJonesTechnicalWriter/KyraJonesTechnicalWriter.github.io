description: One of the classes I took in Spring 2024 required me to take part in a short internship. After some looking, I received the chance to shadow the writing department at Stampin’ Up!, a local paper crafting business.

The project I completed was published in Stampin’ Up! SharePoint site for the agents in the contact center to use. The department uses a SCORE system to request task completion and notate interactions with customers and demonstrators. To ensure consistency and answer questions, I created an Incident Tracking Guide. This project took most of my internship to complete, as it involved extensive discussions with many different departments to understand their needs and perspectives.

I also did some copywriting during my internship. Below, I included screenshots of a social media post I wrote for the company. The writing team posted it on Facebook and Instagram on May 12th, 2024. According to one of my mentors in that department, it received much interaction, which was rare for a product promotion post.
