description: From July 2019 to May 2023, I worked in the contact center at Cyprus Credit Union. I was the first member of the messaging sub-team and single-handedly wrote all templates for our text, email, and chat system responses. I was also tasked to learn all about the new system we converted to during a core system change. I was entrusted with creating the SOPs, reference sheets, training materials and FAQ sheets to assist with the coversion training.

# Cyprus Credit Union
<br>

## Internal Documentation
Most of the documents I crafted were for internal use. These included SOPs, reference sheets, and training materials. All sensitive information has been redacted.
<br>
<br>

#### Style Guide
The official style guide was one of the most exciting things I wrote while at Cyprus Credit Union. I worked with a few different departments, training and HR, as well as the managers in the contact center, to finish this. I needed to ensure all the information was consistent with the pre-existing Cyprus documentation and training’s voice, goals, and scheme. Along with their approvals and assistance, I completed the style guide. Disclosure: the section “Brand Image and Identity” was written entirely by my HR department and provided to me to include in the document.

#### Bill Pay: Second Account
Bill Pay was one of the many systems we used at Cyprus Credit Union. This system allowed our members to send payments electronically or as physical checks. This document walks the supervisor through approving a second account on Bill Pay.

#### Closing Checklist
Each night, one of my coworkers or I had to close our cash advance machine and ensure it was balanced. We also had to scan receipts and cashier check stubs into our document retrieval system, OnBase. This document details all the steps to the Contact Center closing procedures.

#### Common Declines in iQ
The card system that Cyprus Credit Union used was called "iQ". This document details the reason for a denial and why that denial occurred.

#### CPI
Collateral Protection Insurance, CPI, was insurance billed to a member’s loan if they still needed to provide Cyprus CU with proof of insurance. CPI was a common inquiry the representatives in the Contact Center received, so I created this document to answer their questions.

#### Shared Branching
Shared Branching is the name of a network of credit unions that allows transactions to be done at a credit union that a member doesn’t belong to. For example, a member of Cyprus Credit Union could go to Goldenwest Credit Union to complete a transaction on their account and vice versa. This document explains Shared Branching and troubleshoots potential issues.

## Member-Facing Documentation
I also created a few documents that we could provide to our members to assist with more complicated tasks.
<br>
<br>

#### Uploading Documents
Cyprus Credit Union used Citrix Sharefile, through which we sent and received files. This document walks our members through uploading their documents via Citrix Sharefile.
