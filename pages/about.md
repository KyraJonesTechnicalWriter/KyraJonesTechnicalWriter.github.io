# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

During my tenure at Cyprus Credit Union, I discovered my passion for technical documentation. After I was promoted to Contact Center Team Lead, the company underwent a core system change. I was one of the few people entrusted with learning the system and training my coworkers on it. While exploring the new system and writing SOPs, I realized that it was something I wanted to do as my career.

I decided to return to school to chase my newfound dream, and I’m proud to say I finished school in April 2025. I graduated from Weber State University with a BA in English (emphasis on Technical and Professional Writing).

I have yet to receive an official job as a technical writer, but I have created documentation for nearly every workplace of mine in the last 7 years. The companies didn’t support any software other than Microsoft Word and Adobe, so each of my example projects uses these systems. But I’m consistently expanding my knowledge and tools through schooling and self-study. An example of this would be this very website! A remarkable developer coded the website’s theme, but I created the site and all its content using Ruby, Jekyll, Markdown, and HTML.
